# Agri-Energy Connect Platform Prototype  

## Overview  
The Agri-Energy Connect Platform is a prototype application developed to demonstrate a secure, role-based information management system for farmers and employees. This project showcases the use of modern web development tools and best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and secure applications.  

## Key Features  
- **Role-Based Access Control**:  
  - Farmers can add and view their own product listings.  
  - Employees can manage farmer profiles and view all product listings with search functionality.  
- **Secure Authentication**:  
  - Implemented using ASP.NET Core Identity, including role management and password encryption.  
- **CRUD Operations**:  
  - Fully functional Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for farmer profiles and product entries.  
- **Validation**:  
  - Both client-side and server-side validation using data annotations to ensure consistent data integrity.  

## Technologies and Tools Used  
### Backend  
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: For building a scalable, model-view-controller-based web application.  
- **Entity Framework Core**: For object-relational mapping and seamless database interaction.  
- **SQL Server**: As the relational database for storing application data.  
- **Identity Framework**: For implementing secure user authentication and role management.  

### Frontend  
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive, mobile-first user interface design.  

### Development Environment  
- **Visual Studio**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and testing.  

### DevOps and Code Quality  
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes and collaboration.  
- **GitHub**: Repository hosting and project collaboration.  

## Learning Objectives and Achievements  
- **Role Management**: Gained hands-on experience in implementing user roles and permissions in a secure application.  
- **Database Design**: Designed relational database schemas and integrated them using Entity Framework Core.  
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Improved data reliability with comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messaging.  
- **Secure Authentication**: Applied best practices for securing user accounts with password hashing and role-based access.  
- **UI/UX Design**: Delivered a responsive and intuitive user interface with Bootstrap.  

## How This Project Demonstrates My Skills  
This project highlights my ability to:  
- Build secure and scalable web applications using industry-standard tools and technologies.  
- Design and implement role-based access control systems.  
- Integrate backend technologies with a relational database for dynamic data-driven applications.  
- Ensure application reliability with robust validation and error-handling mechanisms.  

## Future Improvements  
- **API Integration**: Add RESTful APIs for external system integrations.  
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Expand the system to support multiple organizations.  
- **Real-Time Features**: Incorporate real-time updates using SignalR.  

## Conclusion  
The Agri-Energy Connect Platform prototype is a demonstration of my proficiency in full-stack web development, showcasing skills in secure application development, database integration, and responsive design. This project exemplifies my ability to deliver functional, secure, and user-friendly software solutions.
